Here's a brief overview of the use of each of these Python packages:


## pip install fastapi:
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use and fast to run, making it a popular choice for building APIs quickly.


## pip install google-auth-oauthlib:
google-auth-oauthlib is a library that provides OAuth 2.0 authentication for Google APIs. It helps you authenticate users and authorize access to their Google accounts securely. This is useful when working with services like Google Calendar, Drive, or Gmail APIs.


## pip install google-api-python-client:
google-api-python-client is a Python client library for accessing Google's APIs. It simplifies interacting with various Google services such as Google Calendar, Google Drive, YouTube, etc. It handles the complexity of making HTTP requests and processing JSON responses from these APIs.


## pip install pytz:
pytz is a Python library that provides timezone definitions and timezone-aware datetime calculations. It allows you to work with datetime objects while accounting for different timezones accurately. This is particularly useful when dealing with international applications or scheduling tasks across different timezones.


## pip install uvicorn:
uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation for Python. It's used to run ASGI applications, including those built with FastAPI. ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a standard for building asynchronous web applications and servers in Python. Uvicorn supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket protocols.


## pip install requests:
requests is a simple yet powerful HTTP library for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making HTTP requests and parsing responses into a simpler API, making it easier to interact with web services and APIs. It supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handles sessions, cookies, headers, and more.


## pip install pydantic:
pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python. It provides a way to define data schemas using Python type annotations, which are then used for data validation, serialization, and deserialization. Pydantic is commonly used with FastAPI to define request and response models, ensuring data integrity and type safety.
